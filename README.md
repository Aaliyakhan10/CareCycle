# CareCycle

**CareCycle** is a community-driven Android application that helps reduce food and product waste while supporting people in need. Individuals and restaurants can donate leftover food within a 1km radius, while expired or soon-to-expire packaged and personal care items are collected weekly. These items are recycled into animal feed, fertilizers, biogas, cleaning, or beauty products. Donors earn coins that can be converted into vouchers or coupons through partnered brands, creating a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem.
